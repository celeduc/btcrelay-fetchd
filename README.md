### Why be a relayer for BTC Relay?

Everytime that a transaction is verified that's in a block header that you submit, you can earn some fees.  See [BTC Relay Incentives for Relayers.](https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/tree/master#incentives-for-relayers)

### Quick Start

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Run an Ethereum client, unlock an account with some Ether, and enable RPC (localhost and port 8545).

1. Get the [address of the BTC Relay contract](https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/tree/master#btc-relay-contract-address-and-abi)

1. `python fetchd.py -s <YourUnlockedAccount> -r <BTCRelayAddress> -n btc --rpcPort 8545 --fetch -d --gasPrice 200000000000`  use YourUnlockedAccount

If you want to set a fee, which is specified in units of wei, add `--fee <weiAmount>`

The `-d` runs in daemon mode, so remove it if undesired.


### Recommended

Before `pip install -r requirements.txt` you may want to use a virtualenv and
may need to do the following:

1. `sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev`
1. `pip install virtualenv`

Then these steps:
```
$ cd my_project_folder
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
